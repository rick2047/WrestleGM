## 1. Documentation Structure
- [x] 1.1 Define MkDocs navigation for architecture, simulation, UI, implementation reference, and API reference pages.
- [x] 1.2 Create or update `docs/index.md` with a project overview and doc entry points.
- [x] 1.3 Add architecture, simulation, UI, and implementation reference pages with current behavior and design constraints.
- [x] 1.4 Document Textual UI flows, screen responsibilities, and component composition details.

## 2. API Reference From Docstrings
- [x] 2.1 Add mkdocstrings (Python handler) configuration to MkDocs.
- [x] 2.2 Add an API reference page that renders `wrestlegm` module docstrings.
- [x] 2.3 Ensure public modules/classes/functions have clear docstrings where needed for reference output.

## 3. Validation
- [x] 3.1 Build documentation via `uv run mkdocs build`.

## 4. Documentation Enhancements
- [x] 4.1 Expand architecture documentation with deeper module responsibilities and data flow notes.
- [x] 4.2 Expand simulation documentation with rule breakdowns and constraints.
- [x] 4.3 Expand UI documentation with per-screen responsibilities, navigation behavior, and component composition detail.

## 5. API Reference Organization and Coverage
- [x] 5.1 Group API reference content by domain sections for readability.
- [x] 5.2 Add docstrings to all public functions and ensure coverage in API output.

## 6. Validation
- [x] 6.1 Build documentation via `uv run mkdocs build`.
