## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Deterministic promo simulation pipeline
The system SHALL simulate each promo using a rating step and a stat delta step using the same seeded RNG instance owned by a `SimulationEngine`.

#### Scenario: Deterministic promo ratings with same inputs
- **WHEN** the same wrestler stats and seed are used
- **THEN** promo ratings and deltas are identical across runs

### Requirement: Promo rating simulation formula and bounds
The system SHALL compute promo ratings in 0–100 space from mic skill and popularity, apply variance using one RNG draw with `PROMO_VARIANCE = 8`, clamp, and convert to 0.0–5.0 stars using the shared conversion rules.

#### Scenario: Promo rating computation and clamping
- **WHEN** a promo rating is simulated
- **THEN** `base_100 = mic_skill * 0.7 + popularity * 0.3`
- **AND THEN** one RNG draw applies `swing` in `[-PROMO_VARIANCE, +PROMO_VARIANCE]`
- **AND THEN** `rating_100` is clamped to 0–100 and converted to stars via `round((rating_100/100)*5, 1)`

### Requirement: Promo stat delta rules
The system SHALL apply fixed popularity deltas based on promo quality and grant stamina recovery during promos.

#### Scenario: Promo popularity deltas
- **WHEN** a promo rating is below 50
- **THEN** the wrestler popularity delta is -5
- **AND WHEN** a promo rating is at least 50
- **THEN** the wrestler popularity delta is +5

#### Scenario: Promo stamina recovery
- **WHEN** a wrestler appears in a promo slot
- **THEN** the wrestler stamina delta is `floor(STAMINA_RECOVERY_PER_SHOW / 2)`

## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Show rating aggregation
The system SHALL compute the overall show rating as the arithmetic mean of match and promo ratings.

#### Scenario: Aggregate show rating
- **WHEN** a show has slot ratings for matches and promos
- **THEN** the show rating equals their arithmetic mean
