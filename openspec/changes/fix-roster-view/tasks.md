## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Confirm the roster is generated once at game start and stored in `GameState`.
- [x] 1.2 Clear the roster ListView before repopulating on screen resume.
- [x] 1.3 Rebuild roster rows from `GameState` without reusing mounted children.

## 2. Validation
- [ ] 2.1 Confirm returning to the roster screen no longer raises `DuplicateIds`.
