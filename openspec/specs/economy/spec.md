# economy Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-money. Update Purpose after archive.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Promotion money tracking
The system SHALL track a promotion-level `money` value as an integer that may be negative after a show completes.

#### Scenario: Money stored on game state
- **WHEN** a new game is started
- **THEN** the game state includes a `money` value initialized for the session

#### Scenario: Money may be negative
- **WHEN** show costs exceed current money
- **THEN** the resulting money value may be negative

### Requirement: Wrestler booking price formula
The system SHALL compute a wrestler booking price from popularity and charge it once per unique wrestler per show.

#### Scenario: Wrestler price computed from popularity
- **WHEN** a wrestler has popularity `pop`
- **THEN** their booking price is `BASE + A * (pop ** 1.2)` with defaults `BASE = 100` and `A = 10`

#### Scenario: Unique wrestler billing per show
- **WHEN** a wrestler appears in multiple slots on the same show (matches and/or promos)
- **THEN** their booking price is charged once for that show

### Requirement: Show cost calculation
The system SHALL compute total show cost as the sum of unique wrestler prices plus match type base costs.

#### Scenario: Show cost includes match type base costs
- **WHEN** a show is fully booked
- **THEN** the show cost equals `sum(unique_wrestler_price) + sum(match_type.base_cost)`

#### Scenario: Promos have no direct cost
- **WHEN** a wrestler appears only in promo slots
- **THEN** the cost contribution is only their unique wrestler booking price

### Requirement: Audience inputs and base
The system SHALL compute audience from card composition and rivalry state using deterministic inputs.

#### Scenario: Audience input fields
- **WHEN** a show card is evaluated for audience
- **THEN** inputs include `pop_sum`, `align_score`, `rivalry_count`, `cooldown_count`, and a deterministic RNG swing

#### Scenario: Audience base from popularity
- **WHEN** `pop_sum` is computed from unique booked wrestlers (matches + promos)
- **THEN** `base_from_pop(pop_sum) = pop_sum * 20`

### Requirement: Alignment scoring
The system SHALL define `align_score` as the count of face-versus-heel pairs across all matches.

#### Scenario: Singles alignment scoring
- **WHEN** a singles match has one Face and one Heel
- **THEN** `align_score` increments by 1 for that match

#### Scenario: Multi-man alignment scoring
- **WHEN** a match has N wrestlers
- **THEN** `align_score` increments once for each unordered pair with opposite alignment

### Requirement: Audience curve and bounds
The system SHALL apply a curved mapping for rivalry/alignment bonuses and cooldown penalties and clamp audience to a non-negative value.

#### Scenario: Audience calculation with curve
- **WHEN** audience is computed
- **THEN** `audience = base_from_pop(pop_sum) + bonus(align_score, rivalry_count) - penalty(cooldown_count) + rng_swing`

#### Scenario: Audience non-negative floor
- **WHEN** audience is computed
- **THEN** it is clamped to be at least 0

### Requirement: Gate income calculation
The system SHALL compute gate income directly from audience using a linear rate.

#### Scenario: Gate income is linear
- **WHEN** audience is computed
- **THEN** `gate_income = audience * GATE_RATE` with default `GATE_RATE = 1`

### Requirement: Merch income calculation
The system SHALL compute merch income from audience and show rating using a curved conversion rate.

#### Scenario: Merch income uses show rating
- **WHEN** merch income is computed
- **THEN** it uses show rating as the quality input

#### Scenario: Merch rate default curve
- **WHEN** merch rate is computed
- **THEN** `merch_rate = clamp(0.05 + 0.02*show_rating + 0.01*show_rating^2, 0.05, 0.50)`

### Requirement: RNG swing behavior
The system SHALL apply deterministic RNG swings to audience and merch income.

#### Scenario: Audience RNG swing range
- **WHEN** audience is computed
- **THEN** it uses a deterministic multiplier in the range `0.8..1.2`

#### Scenario: Merch RNG swing independence
- **WHEN** merch income is computed
- **THEN** it uses an independent deterministic multiplier in the range `0.8..1.2`

### Requirement: Money update timing
The system SHALL apply costs and income after show results are computed.

#### Scenario: Money update order
- **WHEN** a show completes simulation and results are stored
- **THEN** money is updated as `money = money - show_cost + gate_income + merch_income`

### Requirement: Bankruptcy rule
The system SHALL allow debt but enforce bankruptcy when the next show cannot be afforded.

#### Scenario: Debt allowed after show
- **WHEN** a show completes with costs exceeding current money
- **THEN** the resulting money may be negative

#### Scenario: Bankruptcy check at next booking
- **WHEN** the player attempts to book the next show
- **THEN** the system computes `min_valid_show_cost` for any valid 3-match, 2-promo card
- **AND THEN** if `current_money < min_valid_show_cost`, the system transitions to Game Over: Bankruptcy
