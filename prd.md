# WrestleGM – Textual MVP Product Requirements Document

> **Living document**: This PRD defines the full MVP for WrestleGM as a **Textual-based wrestling management game**. It is intended to be iteratively expanded and refined together. This document establishes the foundation for a complete MVP focused on *show-by-show progression*.

---

## 1. Vision & Goals

### 1.1 Product Vision

WrestleGM is a **terminal-first wrestling management game** where the player runs a wrestling promotion **one show at a time**. Each show consists of a booked card of matches, and the core pleasure of the game comes from watching how wrestler stats evolve **across shows**, not from winning a single match.

The experience should feel:

- Systemic, not scripted
- Deterministic but expressive
- Focused on *long-term progression*
- Playable entirely via keyboard
- Comfortable on narrow terminals

---

### 1.2 MVP Goals (Show-Centric)

The MVP must allow a player to:

- Run an **ongoing series of shows** (weekly, episodic, or abstract)
- Book matches and promos for each show
- Select match categories and stipulations that meaningfully affect match outcomes
- Simulate matches and promos to complete an entire show
- Receive an **overall show rating** derived from slot quality
- Advance from show to show and **observe stat evolution over time**
- Make booking decisions based on fatigue, popularity, and long-term impact

The primary success criterion of the MVP is:

> *After multiple shows, the roster and show quality clearly change based on player booking decisions.*

Outcomes:

- A repeatable **show → results → progression** loop
- Clear cause-and-effect between booking, match quality, and long-term stats
- Extensible systems with no hardcoded content

---

## 2. Design Principles

- **Show-first design**: All progression is evaluated at show boundaries
- **Textual-first UI**: Widgets and CSS are the source of consistency
- **Data-driven domain**: Wrestlers and stipulations (rules) come from data files
- **Deterministic simulation**: Same inputs + seed = same results
- **Keyboard-only navigation**: No mouse assumptions
- **Explicit systems**: Outcomes are explainable via numbers, not hidden scripts

---

## 2.1 CI & Automation (PR Validation)

These rules define how pull requests are validated in CI.

- Pull requests run automated tests via `uv run pytest`.
- PR test results are posted as a single sticky comment that updates on each run.
- The comment lists test cases grouped by class in collapsible sections with per-test emoji statuses:
  - ✅ passed
  - ❌ failed
  - 🛑 error
  - ⚠️ skipped
- UI flow tests run before UI snapshot tests.
- UI snapshot tests run in a separate job after simulation and UI flow tests pass.
- Snapshot diff artifacts are uploaded when UI snapshot tests fail.
- Workflow permissions are minimal: read repository contents, write PR comments.
- PR test workflow runs only when changes touch:
  - `tests/**`
  - `wrestlegm/**`
  - `data/**`
  - `main.py`
  - `pyproject.toml`
  - `uv.lock`
  - `.github/workflows/pr-tests.yml`

---

## 3. Core Game Loop (MVP)

1. Start from Main Menu and select New Game
2. Land on the Game Hub (session home)
3. Open the current show overview / booking hub
4. Build or review the show card
5. Book matches and promos (wrestlers + category + stipulation for matches)
6. Run the show (simulate slots sequentially)
7. Review results and **overall show rating**
8. Return to the Game Hub and advance to the next show

The game loop is **show-driven**, not match-driven.

---

---

## 5. Simulation System

The simulation layer is deterministic, side-effect free, and composed of match and promo simulations plus one aggregation step. The following rules apply to *every slot* in a show.

---

### 5.1 Simulation Pipeline (Authoritative)

For each slot, the engine executes the following pipeline:

1. **Match Outcome Simulation** → determines winner / non-winners (matches only)
2. **Rating Simulation** → determines slot quality (stars)
3. **Stat Delta Simulation** → determines progression deltas (no mutation)

After *all* slots in a show complete:

4. **Show Rating Aggregation** → derives overall show rating
5. **State Application** → applies all stat deltas at show end

No other simulation steps exist in the MVP.

Implementation ownership:

- `SimulationEngine` owns RNG and match simulation steps.
- `ShowApplier` applies deltas and recovery at show end.

---

### 5.2 Determinism & RNG Governance

**Single RNG rule**

- All randomness must flow through a single RNG instance seeded from game state.
- The seed is stored in global state and must be persisted.

**Reproducibility rule**

- Given identical inputs (roster stats, stipulation config, show card, and seed), the simulation must always return identical outputs (winners, match ratings, deltas, show rating).

**No hidden inputs**

- Simulation must not depend on wall-clock time, UI focus, ordering artifacts, or any non-explicit state.

**RNG usage discipline**

- Outcome simulation uses exactly one RNG draw per match (the final probability sample).
- Rating simulation uses one RNG draw per match (variance swing).
- Show rating uses no RNG.

---

### 5.3 Outcome Simulation (Who Wins)

**Purpose** Determine the winner and non-winners for a match based on deterministic “power” and match-type “chaos”.

**Inputs**

- Wrestlers: `popularity`, `stamina` (2–4 total)
- Match type: `outcome_chaos` (float 0.0–1.0)
- Tunable constants: `P_WEIGHT`, `S_WEIGHT`
- Seeded RNG

**Step A — Deterministic power** Power is calculated without randomness:

- `power_i = popularity_i * P_WEIGHT + stamina_i * S_WEIGHT`

Constraints:

- Popularity and stamina are expected to be in `0–100`.
- `P_WEIGHT + S_WEIGHT = 1.0` is recommended.

**Step B — Power to base win probability**

- `p_base_i = power_i / sum(power_i)`
- If total power is `0`, treat all `p_base_i` as uniform.

**Step C — Apply match-type chaos (variance-only design)** Match types affect outcome only by pulling each probability toward uniform:

- `uniform = 1 / N`
- `p_final_i = lerp(p_base_i, uniform, outcome_chaos)`
- Normalize `p_final_i` so the total equals `1.0`

Where:

- `outcome_chaos = 0.0` → purely power-based
- `outcome_chaos = 1.0` → uniform odds across all wrestlers

**Step D — Sample winner**

- draw `r = rng.random()` in `[0,1)`
- select the first wrestler where cumulative `p_final_i` exceeds `r`

**Outputs**

- `winner_id`, `non_winner_ids`

**Recommended debug payload (for testing & balancing)**

- `powers[]`
- `p_base[]`, `outcome_chaos`, `p_final[]`
- `r` (sample), `winner_id`

---

### 5.4 Rating Simulation (How Good It Was)

**Purpose** Assign a match quality rating in **0.0–5.0 stars**, independent of who won.

**Inputs**

- Wrestlers: `popularity`, `stamina`, `alignment` (2–4 total)
- Match type: `rating_bonus`, `rating_variance`
- Tunable constants: `POP_W`, `STA_W`, `ALIGN_BONUS`
- Seeded RNG

**Internal representation** Rating is first computed in `0–100` space for ease of tuning, then converted to stars.

**Step A — Compute deterministic base in 0–100**

- `pop_avg = average(pop_i)`
- `sta_avg = average(sta_i)`
- `base_100 = pop_avg * POP_W + sta_avg * STA_W`

Priority guarantee:

- Popularity is priority 1 (so `POP_W > STA_W`).
- Stamina is priority 2.

**Step B — Alignment modifier (wrestling psychology)** Alignment affects rating only:

- 1v1 special case: Face vs Heel → `alignment_mod = +ALIGN_BONUS`, Heel vs Heel → `alignment_mod = -2 * ALIGN_BONUS`, Face vs Face → `alignment_mod = 0`
- Multi-man case (3+): All heels → `alignment_mod = -2 * ALIGN_BONUS`, All faces → `alignment_mod = 0`, Heels > faces → `alignment_mod = +ALIGN_BONUS`, Heels = faces → `alignment_mod = 0`, Faces > heels → `alignment_mod = -2 * ALIGN_BONUS`
  - Design note: the Faces > heels penalty is intentionally stronger to discourage face-heavy multi-man matches.

Then:

- `base_100 += alignment_mod`

**Step C — Match type rating bonus**

- `base_100 += rating_bonus`

**Step D — Apply rating variance (after deterministic logic)**

- `swing = rng.randint(-rating_variance, +rating_variance)`
- `rating_100 = base_100 + swing`

**Step E — Clamp 0–100**

- `rating_100 = clamp(rating_100, 0, 100)`

**Step F — Convert to 0–5 stars**

- `rating_stars = round((rating_100 / 100) * 5, 1)`

**Outputs**

- `match_rating_stars` (0.0–5.0)

**Recommended debug payload**

- `pop_avg`, `sta_avg`
- `base_100`, `alignment_mod`
- `rating_bonus`, `rating_variance`, `swing`
- `rating_100`, `rating_stars`

---

### 5.5 Promo Rating Simulation (How Good It Was)

**Purpose** Assign a promo quality rating in **0.0–5.0 stars** based on mic skill and popularity.

**Inputs**

- Wrestler: `mic_skill`, `popularity`
- Tunable constants: `PROMO_VARIANCE`
- Seeded RNG

**Step A — Compute deterministic base in 0–100**

- `base_100 = mic_skill * 0.7 + popularity * 0.3`

**Step B — Apply rating variance**

- `swing = rng.randint(-PROMO_VARIANCE, +PROMO_VARIANCE)`
- `rating_100 = base_100 + swing`

**Step C — Clamp 0–100**

- `rating_100 = clamp(rating_100, 0, 100)`

**Step D — Convert to 0–5 stars**

- `rating_stars = round((rating_100 / 100) * 5, 1)`

---

### 5.6 Promo Stat Delta Simulation (Progression Impact)

**Purpose** Produce progression deltas for promo performers.

**Popularity deltas**

- If `rating_100 < 50` → `Δpop = -5`
- If `rating_100 ≥ 50` → `Δpop = +5`

**Stamina deltas**

- `Δsta = floor(STAMINA_RECOVERY_PER_SHOW / 2)`

---

### 5.7 Match Stat Delta Simulation (Progression Impact)

**Purpose** Produce progression deltas for winner and non-winners. This system produces deltas only and never mutates roster state.

**Inputs**

- Match outcome: `winner_id`, `non_winner_ids`
- Match type modifiers:
  - `popularity_delta_winner`
  - `popularity_delta_loser`
  - `stamina_cost_winner`
  - `stamina_cost_loser`

**Popularity deltas (data-driven)**

- `Δpop_winner = popularity_delta_winner`
- `Δpop_non_winner = popularity_delta_loser`

Notes:

- Loser popularity delta may be **positive, zero, or negative**.
- Match rating does **not** affect popularity in MVP.

**Stamina deltas (fixed for MVP)**

- `Δsta_winner = -stamina_cost_winner`
- `Δsta_non_winner = -stamina_cost_loser`

Notes:

- Stamina cost is fixed per stipulation.
- Match rating does **not** scale stamina costs in MVP.

**Outputs**

- `stat_deltas[winner_id] = {popularity: Δpop_winner, stamina: Δsta_winner}`
- Each `non_winner_id` receives `{popularity: Δpop_non_winner, stamina: Δsta_non_winner}`

---

### 5.8 Show Rating Aggregation

**Purpose** Compute an overall show quality rating derived from slot ratings.

**Rules (MVP)**

- Each slot produces a star rating.
- Show rating is the arithmetic mean of all slot ratings:
  - `show_rating = average(slot_ratings[])`

Constraints:

- Must be computed after all matches are simulated.
- Deterministic aggregation (no RNG).
- If there are no match ratings, the show rating is `0.0`.

---

### 5.9 State Application at Show End

**Purpose** Apply all deltas once a show completes. This is the only moment the roster changes.

Rules:

- Apply deltas for each wrestler exactly once.
- Clamp after application:
  - Popularity is clamped to `0–100`.
  - Stamina is clamped to `0–100`.
- State mutation is owned by a dedicated `ShowApplier` and triggered via `GameState.run_show()`.

Ordering:

- The order of applying deltas must not change results.
- Recommended approach: compute all new values first, then commit.

---

### 5.10 Required Tests for Simulation

Minimum required tests:

- Determinism: same inputs + seed → identical outputs
- Outcome sanity: probabilities normalize and sum to 1.0
- Rating bounds: always 0.0–5.0 stars
- Multi-man determinism: identical multi-man inputs + seed → identical winner and non-winners
- Alignment cases: 1v1 special-case modifiers and multi-man face/heel mixes
- Promo determinism: same inputs + seed → identical promo ratings and deltas
- Promo deltas: threshold produces -5/+5 and stamina recovery
- Delta correctness: winner/non-winner deltas match match-type config
- Show rating: equals mean of slot ratings
- Clamp tests: stats never exceed 0–100 after application

---

## 6. Show Structure Rules

This section defines how a **show** is structured, what constraints apply when booking it, and how it interacts with the simulation system. These rules are part of the MVP and intentionally simple but explicit.

---

### 6.1 What a Show Is

A **Show** is the atomic unit of progression in WrestleGM.

A show:

- Consists of a finite list of match and promo slots (the card)
- Is fully booked before simulation starts
- Is simulated slot-by-slot in a fixed order
- Produces:
  - Match and promo results
  - Match and promo ratings
  - A single overall show rating
- Applies all stat changes only at show end

Once a show begins simulation, its card is **locked**.

---

### 6.2 Card Size (MVP)

For MVP, show size is intentionally fixed.

**Rules**

- Each show consists of **exactly 3 matches and 2 promos**
- The order of slots matters only for presentation, not simulation
- No weighting (e.g. main event bonus) is applied in MVP

Rationale:

- Forces meaningful booking decisions
- Keeps pacing tight
- Simplifies UI and testing

---

### 6.3 Match Slots & Booking Flow

A show card contains ordered slots:

- Slot 1: Match
- Slot 2: Promo
- Slot 3: Match
- Slot 4: Promo
- Slot 5: Match

Each slot must be fully specified before the show can run:

- 2–4 wrestlers per match (based on match category)
- Match Category
- Stipulation (rules)
- Promo Wrestler (for promo slots)

A show cannot be simulated unless **all slots are valid**.

---

### 6.4 Wrestler Usage Constraints (MVP)

**Per-show constraints**

- A wrestler may appear in **only one slot per show** (match or promo)

**Validation rules**

- Once a wrestler is selected in any slot, they are unavailable for other slots
- Attempting to select an unavailable wrestler must be blocked in UI

Rationale:

- Prevents overbooking exploits
- Keeps stamina meaningful

---

### 6.5 Availability & Fatigue (MVP)

For MVP, availability is binary and derived directly from stamina.

**Rules**

- Wrestlers with stamina ≤ `STAMINA_MIN_BOOKABLE` cannot be booked in matches
- Low-stamina wrestlers are allowed in promo slots
- Default recommendation: `STAMINA_MIN_BOOKABLE = 10`

Notes:

- No injuries in MVP
- No partial availability
- Recovery is handled between shows (future section)

---

### 6.6 Show Lifecycle

A show progresses through the following states:

1. **Planning**

   - Player books the card
   - Slots can be edited

2. **Locked**

   - Card is complete
   - No edits allowed

3. **Simulating**

   - Matches are simulated sequentially
   - UI shows progress

4. **Completed**

   - Results available
   - Show rating visible
   - Stat deltas ready to apply

5. **Applied**

   - Stat deltas applied
   - Game advances to next show

These states must be explicit in code.

---

### 6.7 Ordering Guarantees

- Slots are simulated in card order
- Simulation order does **not** affect outcomes or ratings in MVP
- All stat deltas are applied together at show end

---

### 6.8 Required Validation Checks

Before a show can be run:

- Card has exactly 3 matches and 2 promos
- Each promo has a wrestler assigned
- No duplicate wrestlers across slots
- All match-booked wrestlers meet stamina requirements
- All match slots have a valid match category and stipulation
- All match slots use the required wrestler count for their match category
- Match types are permitted for the selected category

The UI must prevent invalid shows from being run.

---

## 7. Between-Show Recovery Rules

This section defines how wrestlers recover between shows. Recovery is applied **once per show transition** and depends on whether a wrestler worked on the previous show.

---

### 7.1 Recovery Timing

Recovery occurs:

- After a show is completed
- After all stat deltas from the show are applied
- Before the next show enters the Planning state

Recovery is never applied mid-show.

---

### 7.2 Recovery Eligibility (MVP)

Recovery is **participation-based**.

**Rules**

- Wrestlers who **appeared in any match or promo on the previous show recover no stamina**
- Wrestlers who **did not appear on the show recover stamina**

This makes rest a meaningful booking decision.

---

### 7.3 Stamina Recovery Amount (MVP)

**Rule**

- Eligible (resting) wrestlers recover a fixed amount of stamina.

**Default value**

- `STAMINA_RECOVERY_PER_SHOW = +15`

**Application**

- Recovery applies only to wrestlers who did not appear in any match or promo on the show
- Stamina is clamped to `0–100` after recovery

---

### 7.4 Rationale

- Creates a clear trade-off between using top stars and letting them rest
- Prevents infinite stamina loops
- Encourages roster rotation
- Keeps the system simple but strategically meaningful

---

### 7.5 Explicit Non-Rules (MVP)

The following do **not** exist in MVP:

- Partial recovery for working wrestlers
- Variable recovery based on match rating
- Bonus recovery for main events
- Injuries or lingering fatigue states
- Time-based simulation between shows

These are intentionally deferred.

---

### 7.6 Determinism Guarantee

- Recovery uses no RNG
- Given identical state, recovery always produces identical results

---

## 8. User Experience & Interaction Model

This section defines the **full MVP UX** for WrestleGM, including screens, navigation, validation philosophy, visual indicators, and widget mapping. The UX is designed to be **terminal-first**, keyboard-only, and intentionally opaque where appropriate.

---

### 8.1 UX Design Principles

- Keyboard-only interaction
- Narrow-terminal friendly (≤40 columns)
- No projections, odds, or system hints
- The UI blocks only **logical contradictions**, never **strategic mistakes**
- The player learns systems through repetition and consequence
- **A global footer is always present to show key bindings only**

---

### 8.2 Global Navigation Rules

**Universal keys**

- `↑ / ↓` – move within vertical lists
- `← / →` – move between horizontal fields or buttons (where applicable)
- `Enter` – activate focused element
- `Esc` – back / cancel (context-dependent; no effect on Game Hub)
- `Q` – quit (Main Menu, Game Hub)
- Arrow-key focus loops between lists and action buttons; disabled actions are skipped
- Focus wraps from last to first and first to last within a screen’s focusable controls

**Navigation stack**

- Screens are pushed and popped on a stack
- Selecting an item pops automatically
- Esc pops the current context unless focus is trapped (e.g. modal); Game Hub ignores Esc

**Session persistence rule**

- Temporary state inside a screen (e.g. Match Booking) **persists across subscreens**
- Entering Wrestler Selection or Match Category Selection does not reset in-progress selections
- Temporary state is discarded only when the user explicitly cancels the parent screen

---

### 8.3 Visual Indicator Language

The game uses a **minimal, consistent emoji language**:

| Indicator | Meaning                                         | Blocks Action |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| ⚠️        | Empty / incomplete field                        | Yes           |
| ⛔         | Logical impossibility (e.g. duplicate wrestler) | Yes           |
| 🥱        | Low stamina / fatigued                          | Yes           |
| 📅        | Already booked in another slot                  | Yes           |

Indicators rely on iconography first; color is supplemental.

Alignment is shown by prefixing the wrestler name with an emoji (Face 😃, Heel 😈).

---

### 8.4 Validation Philosophy

- Validation is **binary** at the moment of committing an action
- The system blocks only impossible states
- Low stamina is treated as **unbookable for matches** and is blocked
- Low stamina is allowed for promo booking
- No warnings or advice are shown beyond visual indicators and short inline errors
- Temporary booking state persists until explicitly cancelled

---

### 8.5 Screen List (MVP)

### 8.5.1 Global Footer & Keybinding Display

All screens in WrestleGM include Textual’s built-in **Footer** widget.

**Rules**

- The footer is always visible
- It displays **key bindings only**
- No game state, stats, or hints are shown in the footer
- The footer is the authoritative source for "what actions are available right now"

**Behavior**

- Footer content updates automatically based on focus
- When a modal is open, only modal bindings are shown
- Hidden or internal bindings must not appear in the footer

This ensures discoverability without clutter and keeps the UI self-teaching.

---

---

### 8.12 Match Category Selection Screen

**Components**

- Match category list
- Footer actions:
  - Select
  - Cancel

**Behavior**

- Lists the fixed match categories (Singles, Triple Threat, Fatal 4-Way)
- Selecting a category opens Match Booking with the required number of wrestler slots

---

### 8.13 Match Booking Confirmation (Modal)

Match booking uses a **modal confirmation dialog**, not a separate screen.

**Purpose**

- Prevent accidental booking commits
- Require explicit confirmation without disrupting context

**Presentation**

- Appears as a small modal overlay on top of the Match Booking screen
- Background screen remains visible but non-interactive
- Focus is trapped inside the modal

**Modal content**

- Single-line prompt: `Confirm booking?`

**Actions**

- `Confirm` – commits the booking and returns to Booking Hub
- `Cancel` / `Esc` – closes the modal and returns to Booking

No match details, stats, or repetition are shown in the modal; full context is already visible underneath.

---

### 8.14 Simulating Show Screen

**Components**

- Static status text
- Optional progress indicator

**Behavior**

- No input accepted
- Calls `GameState.run_show()` on entry
- Automatically advances to Show Results after a short delay

---

### 8.15 Show Results Screen

**Components**

- Slot results list:
  - Matches: Winner def. non-winners + match rating (stars only, half-star precision)
  - Promos: Wrestler name + promo rating (stars only)
- Overall show rating (stars only)
- Footer actions:
  - Continue (return to Game Hub)

**Behavior**

- Esc does nothing
- Continue returns to the Game Hub

---

### 8.16 Roster Overview

**Components**

- Wrestler table with Name/Sta/Mic/Pop columns
- Footer action:
  - Back

**Behavior**

- Read-only
- Name cells prefix alignment emoji (Face 😃, Heel 😈) and truncate names longer than 18 characters to 15 + `...`
- Stamina, mic skill, and popularity cells show numbers only
- Popularity cells append 🥱 for low stamina
- List rows are rebuilt on resume to reflect updated show results (no reuse of mounted list item IDs)

### 8.18 Microcopy & Tone Rules
